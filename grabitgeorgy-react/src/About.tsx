      <h2>About Georgy</h2>
      <p>
        Georgy is a bold, stylish force of nature—blending elegance with edge. Whether she’s rocking a pink blazer or streetwear, she owns every look with confidence and charm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her fashion sense is more than style—it’s storytelling. Every outfit is a mood, every pose a message. Georgy doesn’t follow trends—she sets them.
